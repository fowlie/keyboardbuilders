# Keyboard Builders

A website with a list of open source keyboards.

## What is this?

When I first was looking for a keyboard project to build, I couldn't find a complete list of open source keyboards. So I decided to create this website to gather all open source keyboard projects I could find. Please feel free to add more keyboards to `keyboards.json`! :-)
