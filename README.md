# keyboardbuilders

A project to gather a list of open source keyboard projects.

## What is this?

When I was looking for a keyboard project to build, I found it hard to find a list of open source keyboard projects. So I decided to create this repository to gather all the open source keyboard projects I could find. It's a work in progress, so feel free to contribute!
